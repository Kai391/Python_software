The Moon is an astronomical body orbiting Earth and is the planet's only natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest 
satellite in the Solar System, and by far the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet 
that it orbits. The Moon is, after Jupiter's satellite Io, the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among 
those whose densities are known.
