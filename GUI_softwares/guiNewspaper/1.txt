In classical antiquity, there was no real ancient analog of a modern scientist. Instead, philosophers engaged in 
the philosophical study of nature called natural philosophy, a precursor of natural science. It was not until the 
19th century that the term scientist came into regular use after it was coined by the theologian, philosopher, and 
historian of science William Whewell in 1833.
